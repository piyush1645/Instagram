# Instagram Login Page Clone

This project is a clone of the **Instagram Login Page** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The purpose of this project is to replicate the login page of Instagram with a responsive design, and to practice front-end development skills. Additionally, JavaScript is used for **form validation** and a **sliding image carousel** feature.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
- **HTML**: The page structure is created using semantic HTML5 elements, ensuring accessibility and proper form handling.
- **CSS**: A clean and modern design is achieved with CSS. Flexbox and Grid are used for layout, and media queries ensure responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: 
   - **Form Validation**: Ensures that users input a valid email and password before submitting the form.
   - **Sliding Image Carousel**: A smooth, interactive image slider to enhance the visual appeal.
